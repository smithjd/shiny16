Rise and Shiny
======================
John David Smith
- I'm a novice Shiny user
- The name is a bit distracting
- How I was convinced that it's a regular, daily tool
- Recognized it already in regular work flow
- One use case for everyday exploration

Shiny Dawns on me
===================
- R is **all** about (reproducibly) touching and fiddling with your data to think about it
- Conway talk: proving data validity to replicate a phone bill
- Hadley's talk at Reed College where a model's residuals point to war and famine in Africa
- Roger Peng podcast remark that his students **start** exploration using Shiny (but he doesn't)
- Cost of R: it's a (raplidy) moving target
 + dplyr is less than 2 years old but I'm **always** using it now
 + Pushing toward Shiny as an ordinary, garden-variety tool

What Kind of Day is it Today?
========================================================
Very different use cases for Shiny
- Making everyday R activities more interactive
- Informal exploratory analysis

Always reflect on daily workflow!
